# Fashion Mix: A Virtual Styling Platform to Prevent Fashion Waste

## Team 7 - COMPSCI 326 Web Programming

### Project Description

#### Problem
Fashion overconsumption leads to significant waste when consumers:
- Don't know how to style clothes they already own
- Lack confidence in creating cohesive outfits with their purchases

#### Solution
Fashion Mix provides a virtual styling platform where users can:
- Mix and match clothing items on virtual mannequins before purchasing
- Discover styling options for clothes they already own

#### Key Features
- Categorized clothing library (tops, bottoms, outerwear, accessories, etc.)
- Virtual mannequin styling tool allowing users to mix and match items
- Filters for styles, colors, occasions, seasons, and price ranges
- "Complete the Look" suggestions (showing compatible items across price points)

#### Why This Project?
The fashion industry is the second-largest polluter globally, with fast fashion contributing significantly to waste and environmental damage. Many consumers struggle with styling choices, leading them to repeatedly purchase similar items or discard barely-worn clothing.

This project stems from personal experience in vintage clothing collection, where high-quality, classic pieces become wardrobe staples. By helping users visualize different combinations and styling possibilities without additional purchases, Fashion Mix aims to reduce clothing waste while empowering consumers to make better fashion choices.
